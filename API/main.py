Last year, at the COP26 climate summit in Scotland, the United States was conspicuously absent from a consortium of 40 countries pledging to end coal, a decision which seems to be directly related to the country’s still powerful coal lobby. While the White House is unwilling or politically unable to put an end to coal through policy, it seems that economic forces may do the job for them. As the technology for renewable energies including wind and solar has advanced and economies of scale have kicked into gear, the rapidly dropping prices of clean energy have allowed renewables to undercut coal prices in most of the world. A 2021 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) “found that in the US renewable energy could undercut between three-quarters and 91% of existing coal-fired power plants, while in India renewable energy would be cheaper than between 87% and 91% of new coal plants,” according to reporting from the Guardian. Indeed, according to the most recent Annual Coal Report from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal continued its seemingly terminal decline in 2020, having peaked way back in 2007. The United States, however is no exception to the current global spike in coal usage as supply chain issues, pandemic-fuelled economic woes, and the Russian war in Ukraine continue to rock energy markets and imperil energy security worldwide. Thanks to this confluence of unfortunate events, in 2021 the United States saw the biggest increase in coal usage in more than a decade. The EIA expects this uptick to be temporary, however. And even with the dramatic 17% increase in coal-powered electricity generation last year, coal consumption is still 6% lower than pre-pandemic levels. What’s more, “Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy continued to increase throughout the pandemic, and renewable energy generation (shown here as hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal combined) has increased steadily every year since 2013,” reports Yale Climate Connections. “EIA projections show renewables catching up to coal this year, then surpassing coal in 2023.” How likely is a scenario in which renewables overtake coal in the United States, and where will all of that renewable energy come from? It could be coming sooner than you think. According to new research from Rice University, the fossil fuel bastion state of Texas could replace nearly 100% of its coal output with wind and solar, “as the state has unique climates that can work at complementary times to power its entire electric grid.” This transition is not only possible and ideal for the climate, but would also be economically beneficial for the Lone Star State with the increasingly cheap costs of renewables. The size and climate of Texas make this plan especially feasible and particularly appealing, according to the scientific paper entitled “ Can wind and solar replace coal in Texas? ” As stated by the paper’s authors: “Simply put, it’s not always windy and not always sunny, but it’s almost always windy or sunny somewhere in Texas.” Strategically spread out wind and solar power could allow Texas to increase the reliability and constancy of renewable energy flow to the grid, but reaching this point will require considerable infrastructure improvements including smarter grids and expanding transmission lines to bring the energy to urban areas. With proper investing and infrastructure, an increase of installed solar and wind capacity in Texas would not only grant the state greater energy security and reliability, as well as cheaper and cleaner energy sources, it may also push the state to connect its infamously isolated grid to the national network in order to capitalize on surplus wind and solar power, which could be sold to other states at a profit – not to mention mitigate the risk of another fatal blackout like the 2021 deep freeze .

Media I cover the news media industry, including print, digital, and cable. Apr 2, 2022, 12:15pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin (L to R) Fox\'s Jesse Watters, host of "Jesse Watters Primetime," and "Gutfeld!" host Greg Gutfeld. Fox News Media Mel Gibson sat down on Friday for a conversation with Fox News Channel’s Jesse Watters about his new movie Father Stu — a chat during which the host of Jesse Watters Primetime also tried (unsuccessfully) to get a comment from Gibson about the Will Smith Oscars slap controversy. That moment came at the end of Gibson promoting the new movie in which he plays the father of the titular Stuart Long, a boxer-turned-priest played in the biopic by Mark Wahlberg. An off-camera female voice cut in before Gibson could answer the question about the Oscars slap and told Watters: “Hello, Jesse? Uhm, Thank you. That’s our time.” Watters had tried asking Gibson if the actor thinks he’d have been treated the same way if he, instead of Smith, had slapped comedian Chris Rock during the 94th Academy Awards ceremony. Even though it’s been almost a week since the incident, the question wasn’t entirely out of left field. An hour or so prior, news broke of Smith’s resignation from the Academy as a voting remember. More interesting, though, is the fact that Gibson had decided to appear on Watters’ program in the first place to market Father Stu , which is set to be released later this month in the US. Gibson’s choice of interviewer probably had something to do with the fact that, per Nielsen Media Research, Jesse Watters Primetime is the fastest-growing program in cable news since its launch on January 24 of this year.

In terms of the former, Jesse Watters Primetime is averaging 3.1 million viewers, and 517,000 in A25-54 (more than CNN and MSNBC combined). Watters’ ratings leadership was one of the standout data points in Fox News’ overall first quarter ratings performance, a period in which the cable news network was the only one to make year-over-year ratings gains. The three-month period that kicked off 2022, which saw CNN and MSNBC continuing to experience ratings declines, also saw Fox notch its 81st consecutive quarter as the most-watched network in all of basic cable. Part of that is attributable to an experiment on Fox’s part that has paid off well: Giving new programming slots to both Watters, as well as The Five’s Greg Gutfeld (whose show Gutfeld! will hit its one-year mark on Tuesday, April 5).

(Photo by Omar Vega/Getty Images) Getty Images Like Watters’, Gutfeld’s is also the highest-rated program in all of cable news on the basis of total views during its hour, at 11 pm ET. Gutfeld! , featuring the veteran Fox host’s signature brand of acerbic humor, is also noteworthy for the way it quickly shook up the late-night landscape upon its debut. While the content of both of these programs — Fox’s two newest weekday shows — leans heavily on conservative-friendly political commentary, Gutfeld’s is a bit lighter, with more of the banter and shtick associated with late-night TV. Shaking up late-night And, more importantly, Gutfeld! found a void in the market. Because since its launch in April 2021, the show has averaged almost 2 million viewers and 347,000 in the younger demo. The program soon found itself the second highest-rated in late-night, routinely topping ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! and NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon . Data from Nielsen MRI Fusion also shows that the audience for Gutfeld! is more ideologically diverse — comprising more Democrats, Republicans, and self-styled independents — than any CNN program. The other factor behind the success thus far of both Gutfeld’s and Watters’ shows, meanwhile, has to do with the fact that Fox News Channel not only gave them a time slot of their own — but one wherein they can do the thing which viewers know them best for and clearly want to see more of. For Watters, in other words, it’s political commentary. Gutfeld’s audience, meanwhile, expects humor, and so the host during his late-night slot is there to be comparatively more entertaining than Watters’ commentary-driven show. Fox vs. CNN Contrast that with some recent changes over at CNN, which on March 29 saw the high-profile launch of its new streaming service CNN+ finally come to fruition. The Fox rival not only went on a big hiring spree for its new paid subscription-based service, in addition to pouring millions of dollars of investment into it. CNN also tapped its biggest draws, including anchors like Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper, to host shows for CNN+. But CNN — unlike how Fox had Watters and Gutfeld stick to their knitting — is betting that while Cooper and Tapper are known for hard-hitting journalism chops, they’ll also be able to draw viewers with content that’s a bit different. In Tapper’s case, he’s hosting a book club show for the streaming service, while Cooper’s fronting not one but two programs for CNN+. They include Anderson Cooper Full Circle , during which the newsman will interview “authors, entertainers, mindfulness experts and community leaders,” with a special focus on stories outside of the nation’s capital. The second show is a parenting program, Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper. Follow me on Twitter .

Moldova’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the claim, writing in a tweet there is “no information to confirm the mobilization of troops in the Transnistrian region.” Transnistria's Foreign Ministry called the claim “absolutely untrue,” according to multiple media outlets , adding that all military units in the region are “in places of permanent deployment” and that “even planned activities” have been minimized to de-escalate tensions. Forbes could not independently verify the Ukrainian and Moldovan claims. Big Number 16,000. That’s about how many Ukrainian refugees that have fled into Moldova since the start of the war, Radio Free Europe reports . Moldovan authorities have been monitoring the threat of Russian troops in Transnistria moving into Ukraine as thousands of Ukrainian refugees enter the country—the largest number of refugees per capita received by any country, the Financial Times reports . Key Background Russia has pulled back forces from around Kyiv after Kremlin officials said last week Russia was shifting its focus to the “liberation” of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a speech Friday the eastern portion of the country is preparing for “new, powerful strikes” and described the situation as “extremely difficult.” Tangent Russia accused Ukraine of taking the fight to Russian soil Friday with a daring helicopter gunship assault on a fuel depot in Belgorod, but Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack. The British Ministry of Defense said the attack will likely “add additional short-term strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains.” Further Reading Ukraine Denies Attacking Fuel Depot In Russia ( Forbes ) Russia Appears To Scale Back Goals Of Ukraine Invasion ( Forbes ) Follow me on Twitter .

While the country has a production capacity of over 2 million barrels of oil per day (bopd), oil output stood at 1.3m bopd last year according to government data. As oil prices enter a new supercycle, Nigeria’s production underperformance coupled with continued imports of finished petroleum products expose it to several macroeconomic risks. Since the start of the year, for instance, the country’s petrol subsidies program has become so expensive that the government is now planning to tap into its €2bn Eurobond sale of 2021 to fund it. But while Nigeria cannot control oil prices, it certainly can work towards improving oil production to mitigate vulnerabilities and try to make the best of the current oil prices cycle. In fact, a closer look at current shallow water market activity has observers hopeful that competent local players could be starting to make the difference the country needs. Almost half of Nigeria’s oil production relies on its onshore fields, but repeated crude theft and pipeline vandalism make it challenging to ramp up output there in the short term. Meanwhile, deep-water fields are maturing and there is no clear indication that the recently enacted Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) will revive interest in capital-intensive greenfield deep-water activity in Nigeria. That leaves shallow-water fields as the most promising opportunities to increase output in the short term. So far, shallow-water assets have represented less than a fourth of Nigeria’s oil output despite offering cheaper development options. But as local independents step up to replace IOCs in the country, several developments are back on the table. In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigerian independent First E&P already achieved first oil at its Anyala & Madu complex on OMLs 83 and 85. Since starting production in October 2020, the company has become the third biggest local producer after SEEPCo and Seplat Energy. Related: What The West Is Getting Wrong About OPEC First E&P’s joint-venture with Dangote Industries, West Africa E&P (WAEP), is now embarking on the development of the Kalaekule field on OML 72. Further west, General Hydrocarbon Limited (GHL), the new operator of OML 120, is also moving ahead with the redevelopment of the Oyo field this year. These projects are currently supporting offshore market activity in Nigeria and have all one thing in common: local content. As IOCs shy away from additional investments in Nigeria and exit some of their licenses, Nigeria is left to rely on its local operators and local services companies to take the lead. Both WAEP and GHL have selected the Century Group, the only Nigerian wholly-owned company providing FPSO solutions at the moment, to provide the FPSOs required for the Kalaekule and Oyo fields. The company is one of the often-overlooked Nigerian services providers that have, over the years, developed the capacities required to operate and maintain critical oil & gas assets safely and cost-efficiently. While the narrative on Nigeria is dominated by the exit of its biggest foreign investors, the local capacity that the country has built over the past decades is often under-estimated. Since the adoption of the Local Content Act in 2010, several Nigerian energy companies have developed expertise in operating and maintaining critical infrastructure assets. These local players may lack the financial power of IOCs, but they have proven their ability to successfully navigate the country’s above-the-ground risks. The ongoing development of shallow-water fields in Nigeria is sending promising signs to an industry deeply worried about the impact that IOCs’ divestment will have on its future. By not taking chances on new market entrants and putting the right assets in the hands of the right team, the country is steadily finding new equations that could help it navigate current market volatility.
